       "> The meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective question, and there is no universally accepted answer. However, here are some common perspectives on the meaning of life:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Purpose-driven:**\n",
       "> - To fulfill a specific purpose or calling, such as raising a family, pursuing a career, or making a contribution to society.\n",
       "> - To live a life of integrity, virtue, and compassion.\n",
       "> - To find meaning through work, creativity, or other activities that bring fulfillment.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Experience-oriented:**\n",
       "> - To savor the joys and experiences of life, such as love, laughter, travel, and learning.\n",
       "> - To seek out novel and enriching experiences that broaden one's perspective.\n",
       "> - To live in the present moment and appreciate the beauty of everyday life.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Relationship-centered:**\n",
       "> - To connect with others in meaningful ways and build strong relationships.\n",
       "> - To love and be loved unconditionally.\n",
       "> - To support and care for those around us.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Growth-oriented:**\n",
       "> - To learn, grow, and evolve as an individual.\n",
       "> - To challenge oneself, overcome obstacles, and strive for personal development.\n",
       "> - To seek knowledge, wisdom, and self-awareness.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Spiritual:**\n",
       "> - To connect with a higher power or purpose.\n",
       "> - To live in harmony with the universe or nature.\n",
       "> - To seek transcendence or enlightenment.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Existential:**\n",
       "> - To create one's own meaning through choices and actions.\n",
       "> - To confront the absurdity of life and find meaning in the face of it.\n",
       "> - To embrace the unknown and live life on one's own terms.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Ultimately, the meaning of life is something that each individual must discover for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and what is meaningful to one person may not be meaningful to another. The key is to live intentionally, to find what brings joy and fulfillment to your life, and to connect with others in meaningful ways."
